- setup_pythonpath is not needed.
  - For 'python run.py' and 'python src/run.py', this is not required as src will be added automatically.
  - If src is truly missing, setup_pythonpath would need to import load_env.py, which then depends on pythonpath and may not actually load correctly.
  - Not needed for VSCode launch, which can be configured via launch.json.
  - Not needed for online deployment using 'python run.py'.
    - The web entry point might indeed cause src to be missing; this needs to be addressed.
